# CSS Components

This folder contains stories for CSS components. This components doesn't need any JS logic so it's more easy and efficient to only have CSS classes to apply to native HTML elements (expecially for accessibility purposes).

CSS components are stored in the [Design Tokens repository](https://github.com/ZanichelliEditore/design-tokens/).
