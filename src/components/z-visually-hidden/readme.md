# z-visually-hidden

This component visually hide an element while still allowing it to be exposed to assistive technologies (such as screen readers).

There are real world situations where visually hiding content may be appropriate:

- Hide visually the text of <code> ZAriaAlert </code>
- Take advantage of the behavior and semantics of a native element
  like a checkbox or radio button, but replace it with a custom styled
  element visually.
- Hide visually an <code> h1 </code> because could be redundant for a
  sighted user but could be usefull for navigation through
  ScreenReader rotor
