import {Meta, Canvas, Story, Controls} from "@storybook/blocks";
import * as IndexStories from "./index.stories";

<Meta of={IndexStories} />

# ZRangePicker with date

<Canvas>
  <Story of={IndexStories.ZRangePickerWithDate} />
</Canvas>

# ZRangePicker with date and time

<Canvas>
  <Story of={IndexStories.ZRangePickerWithDateAndTime} />
</Canvas>

## Usage

In order to avoid conflits between datepickers, pass a unique id as `rangePickerId` prop.

This component has a callback function `dateSelect` that returns the selected date.
