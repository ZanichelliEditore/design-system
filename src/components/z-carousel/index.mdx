## ZCarousel

This component was conceived as a list of elements to respect the rules of accessibility (https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/carousels/working-example/).

## Usage

Pass any number of elements inside its main `slot`.

```html
<z-carousel>
  <li>element</li>
  <li>element</li>
  <li>element</li>
</z-carousel>
```

> Note: always use `li` elements as direct children of `z-carousel`, as it wraps them with an `ul` element.

You can set the gutter between the elements by using the `--z-carousel-gutter` custom property.
From css:

```css
z-carousel {
  --z-carousel-gutter: calc(var(--space-unit) * 2);
}
```

## Ghost loading

You can handle ghost loading for the whole z-carousel by setting two properties:

- `isLoading` (boolean): to show a `z-ghost-loading` component instead of the carousel content.
- `ghostLoadingHeight` (number): to set the height of the `z-ghost-loading` component.

You can also handle ghost loading of each single z-carousel item (example in the [related story](#manual-loader-for-items) named "Loading items").
