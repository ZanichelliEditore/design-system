### Usage

Breadcrumb is a relevant component for SEO oriented applications.
As the crawlers flatten the light dom and the shadow dom, it is important to move all the relevant SEO content in the light DOM, to not affect indexability.

The component will handle the logic for generating the proper markup inside the shadow dom.
No slot is rendered inside the latter.
Like the other use case, don't pass a custom label to the first child because it will be overwritten by the default home value.
This mode can be also used by SEO non-relevant application.

```html
<z-breadcrumb>
  <a href="./home_link"></a>
  <a href="./link1">link1</a>
  <a href="./link2">link2</a>
  <a href="./link3">link3</a>
</z-breadcrumb>
```
