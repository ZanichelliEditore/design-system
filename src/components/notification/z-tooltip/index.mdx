## ZTooltip

To be sure the algorithm finds the right container, when calculating the position, set its position to `position: relative;`

On the following Story, the "position" prop can be set only for the original positions of the `z-tooltip` by design.

<Meta of={IndexStories} />

<Canvas>
  <Story of={IndexStories.ZTooltip} />
</Canvas>

## Autoclose off

When `closable` property is set to `false`, you can open the tooltip on hover and still click things outside without closing it.
In the Story below, the tooltip is opened hovering the button.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={IndexStories.AutocloseOff} />
</Canvas>

<Controls />
