  <Story of={IndexStories.Horizontal} />

## Vertical

When orientation is set to `VERTICAL`, the text of slotted tabs is hidden by default.
Be sure to put an icon inside the tab to have something visible and don't forget to put an `aria-label` to provide a description for screen readers.

# With tabpanels

This story provides an example of how to handle a `ZNavigationTabs` with switchable `tabpanel`s, which is the most common use for the navigation tabs. Each panel must have the `tabpanel` role and the `aria-labelledby` attribute, referencing the tab that controls it (unless a different label is provided using `aria-label`). Similarly, the `aria-controls` attribute must be set on the tabs with the `id` of the controlled panel.
